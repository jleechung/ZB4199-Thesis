Analogous to next generation sequencing, the cost of sequencing using long-read technologies has materially dropped whilst the instrument throughput continues to increase. Together these changes present the prospect of sequencing large numbers of individuals with the aim of fully characterizing genomes at high resolution. In this article, we will endeavour to present an introduction to long-read technologies showing: what long reads are; how they are distinct from short reads; why long reads are useful and how they are being used. We will highlight the recent developments in this field, and the applications and potential of these technologies in medical research, and clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.}",

abstract={The epitranscriptomics field has undergone an enormous expansion in the last few years; however, a major limitation is the lack of generic methods to map RNA modifications transcriptome-wide. Here, we show that using direct RNA sequencing, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications can be detected with high accuracy, in the form of systematic errors and decreased base-calling qualities. Specifically, we find that our algorithm, trained with m6A-modified and unmodified synthetic sequences, can predict m6A RNA modifications with {\textasciitilde}90{\%} accuracy. We then extend our findings to yeast data sets, finding that our method can identify m6A RNA modifications in vivo with an accuracy of 87{\%}. Moreover, we further validate our method by showing that these {\^a}{\texteuro}˜errors{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} are typically not observed in yeast ime4-knockout strains, which lack m6A modifications. Our results open avenues to investigate the biological roles of RNA modifications in their native RNA context.},

The structural variant caller Sniffles after NGMLR or minimap2 alignment provides the most accurate results, but additional confidence or sensitivity can be obtained by a combination of multiple variant callers. Sensitive and fast results can be obtained by minimap2 for alignment and a combination of Sniffles and SVIM for variant identification. We describe a scalable workflow for identification, annotation, and characterization of tens of thousands of structural variants from long-read genome sequencing of an individual or population. By discussing the results of this well-characterized reference individual, we provide an approximation of what can be expected in future long-read sequencing studies aiming for structural variant identification.},

Here, we investigate whether RNAseq using the long-read single-molecule Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer is able to identify and quantify complex isoforms without sacrificing accurate gene expression quantification. After benchmarking our approach, we analyse individual murine B1a cells using a custom multiplexing strategy. We identify thousands of unannotated transcription start and end sites, as well as hundreds of alternative splicing events in these B1a cells. We also identify hundreds of genes expressed across B1a cells that display multiple complex isoforms, including several B cell-specific surface receptors.

ABSTRACT={The wide implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized the field of medical genetics. However, the short read lengths of currently used sequencing approaches pose a limitation for the identification of structural variants, sequencing repetitive regions, phasing of alleles and distinguishing highly homologous genomic regions. These limitations may significantly contribute to the diagnostic gap in patients with genetic disorders who have undergone standard NGS, like whole exome or even genome sequencing. Now, the emerging long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. LRS has so far mainly been used to investigate genetic disorders with previously known or strongly suspected disease loci. While these targeted approaches already show the potential of LRS, it remains to be seen whether LRS technologies can soon enable true whole genome sequencing routinely. Ultimately, this could allow the de novo assembly of individual whole genomes used as a generic test for genetic disorders. In this article, we summarize the current LRS-based research on human genetic disorders and discuss the potential of these technologies to facilitate the next major advancements in medical genetics.}

abstract={A platform for highly parallel direct sequencing of native RNA strands was recently described by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, but despite initial efforts it remains crucial to further investigate the technology for quantification of complex transcriptomes. Here we undertake native RNA sequencing of polyA{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}+{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttenthousand}RNA from two human cell lines, analysing {\textasciitilde}5.2 million aligned native RNA reads. To enable informative comparisons, we also perform relevant ONT direct cDNA- and Illumina-sequencing. We find that while native RNA sequencing does enable some of the anticipated advantages, key unexpected aspects currently hamper its performance, most notably the quite frequent inability to obtain full-length transcripts from single reads, as well as difficulties to unambiguously infer their true transcript of origin. While characterising issues that need to be addressed when investigating more complex transcriptomes, our study highlights that with some defined improvements, native RNA sequencing could be an important addition to the mammalian transcriptomics toolbox.},

abstract="Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an organism's genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism's biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.",

This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.}",

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has caused a revolution in biology. NGS requires the preparation of libraries in which (fragments of) DNA or RNA molecules are fused with adapters followed by PCR amplification and sequencing. It is evident that robust library preparation methods that produce a representative, non-biased source of nucleic acid material from the genome under investigation are of crucial importance. Nevertheless, it has become clear that NGS libraries for all types of applications contain biases that compromise the quality of NGS datasets and can lead to their erroneous interpretation. A detailed knowledge of the nature of these biases will be essential for a careful interpretation of NGS data on the one hand and will help to find ways to improve library quality or to develop bioinformatics tools to compensate for the bias on the other hand. In this review we discuss the literature on bias in the most common NGS library preparation protocols, both for DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) as well as for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Strikingly, almost all steps of the various protocols have been reported to introduce bias, especially in the case of RNA-seq, which is technically more challenging than DNA-seq. For each type of bias we discuss methods for improvement with a view to providing some useful advice to the researcher who wishes to convert any kind of raw nucleic acid into an NGS library.}

Solved by maximum likelihood estimation, isoform expression can be inferred in RNA-Seq using statistical models based on the assumption that sequenced reads are distributed uniformly along transcripts. Modification of the model is needed when considering situations where RNA-Seq data do not follow uniform distribution.Results: We proposed two curves, the global bias curve (GBC) and the local bias curves (LBCs), to describe the non-uniformity of read distributions for all genes in a transcriptome and for each gene, respectively. Incorporating the bias curves into the uniform read distribution (URD) model, we introduced non-URD (N-URD) models to infer isoform expression levels. On a series of systematic simulation studies, the proposed models outperform the original model in recovering major isoforms and the expression ratio of alternative isoforms. We also applied the new model to real RNA-Seq datasets and found that its inferences on expression ratios of alternative isoforms are more reasonable. The experiments indicate that incorporating N-URD information can improve the accuracy in modeling and inferring isoform expression in RNA-Seq.Contact:zhangxg@tsinghua.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Direct RNA sequencing (direct RNA-seq) using nanopore arrays offers an exciting alternative whereby individual polyadenylated RNAs are sequenced directly, without the recoding and amplification biases inherent to other sequencing methodologies. Here we use direct RNA-seq to profile the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) transcriptome during productive infection of primary cells. We show how direct RNA-seq data can be used to define transcription initiation and RNA cleavage sites associated with all polyadenylated viral RNAs and demonstrate that low level read-through transcription produces a novel class of chimeric HSV-1 transcripts, including a functional mRNA encoding a fusion of the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 and viral membrane glycoprotein L. Thus, direct RNA-seq offers a powerful method to characterize the changing transcriptional landscape of viruses with complex genomes.",

Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically.Results: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20â€“25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.Availability: An initial C++ implementation of our method that was used for the results presented in this article is available at http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem.Contact:cdewey@biostat.wisc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics on}",

However, there are a lack of tools specifically designed for DRS and its ability to identify differential expression in complex organisms is poorly characterised. We developed NanoCount for fast, accurate transcript isoform quantification in DRS and demonstrate it outperforms similar methods. Using synthetic controls and human SH-SY5Y cell differentiation into neuron-like cells, we show that DRS accurately quantifies RNA expression and identifies differential expression of genes and isoforms. Differential expression of 231 genes, 333 isoforms, plus 27 isoform switches were detected between undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and samples clustered by differentiation state at the gene and isoform level. Genes upregulated in neuron-like cells were associated with neurogenesis. NanoCount quantification of thousands of novel isoforms discovered with DRS likewise enabled identification of their differential expression. Our results demonstrate enhanced DRS isoform quantification with NanoCount and establish the ability of DRS to identify biologically relevant differential expression of genes and isoforms.}",

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

However, these methods lose information contained in biological RNA because the copied reads are often short and modifications are not retained. We address these limitations using a native poly(A) RNA sequencing strategy developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Our study generated 9.9 million aligned sequence reads for the human cell line GM12878, using thirty MinION flow cells at six institutions. These native RNA reads had a median length of 771 bases, and a maximum aligned length of over 21,000 bases. Mitochondrial poly(A) reads provided an internal measure of read-length quality. We combined these long nanopore reads with higher accuracy short-reads and annotated GM12878 promoter regions to identify 33,984 plausible RNA isoforms. We describe strategies for assessing 3{\textasciiacutex} poly(A) tail length, base modifications and transcript haplotypes.",

abstract={Transcriptomic analyses have identified tens of thousands of intergenic, intronic, and cis-antisense long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are expressed from mammalian genomes. Despite progress in functional characterization, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs and their half-lives. Although many are easily detectable by a variety of techniques, it has been assumed that lncRNAs are generally unstable, but this has not been examined genome-wide. Utilizing a custom noncoding RNA array, we determined the half-lives of {\^a}ˆ{\textonequarter}800 lncRNAs and {\^a}ˆ{\textonequarter}12,000 mRNAs in the mouse Neuro-2a cell line. We find only a minority of lncRNAs are unstable. LncRNA half-lives vary over a wide range, comparable to, although on average less than, that of mRNAs, suggestive of complex metabolism and widespread functionality. Combining half-lives with comprehensive lncRNA annotations identified hundreds of unstable (half-life < 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs showing extreme stability (half-life > 16 h). Analysis of lncRNA features revealed that intergenic and cis-antisense RNAs are more stable than those derived from introns, as are spliced lncRNAs compared to unspliced (single exon) transcripts. Subcellular localization of lncRNAs indicated widespread trafficking to different cellular locations, with nuclear-localized lncRNAs more likely to be unstable. Surprisingly, one of the least stable lncRNAs is the well-characterized paraspeckle RNA Neat1, suggesting Neat1 instability contributes to the dynamic nature of this subnuclear domain. We have created an online interactive resource (http://stability.matticklab.com) that allows easy navigation of lncRNA and mRNA stability profiles and provides a comprehensive annotation of {\textasciitilde}7200 mouse lncRNAs.},

abstract = {Transcript stability is associated with many biological processes, and the factors affecting mRNA stability have been extensively studied. However, little is known about the features related to human long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) stability. By inhibiting transcription and collecting samples in 10 time points, genome-wide RNA-seq studies was performed in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and RNA half-life datasets were constructed. The following observations were obtained. First, the half-life distributions of both lncRNAs and messanger RNAs (mRNAs) with one exon (lnc-human1 and m-human1) were significantly different from those of both lncRNAs and mRNAs with more than one exon (lnc-human2 and m-human2). Furthermore, some factors such as full-length transcript secondary structures played a contrary role in lnc-human1 and m-human2. Second, through the half-life comparisons of nucleus- and cytoplasm-specific and common lncRNAs and mRNAs, lncRNAs (mRNAs) in the nucleus were found to be less stable than those in the cytoplasm, which was derived from transcripts themselves rather than cellular location. Third, kmers-based protein−RNA or RNA−RNA interactions promoted lncRNA stability from lnc-human1 and decreased mRNA stability from m-human2 with high probability. Finally, through applying deep learning−based regression, a non-linear relationship was found to exist between the half-lives of lncRNAs (mRNAs) and related factors. The present study established lncRNA and mRNA half-life regulation networks in the A549 cell line and shed new light on the degradation behaviors of both lncRNAs and mRNAs.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: RNA-Seq technology based on next-generation sequencing provides the unprecedented ability of studying transcriptomes at high resolution and accuracy, and the potential of measuring expression of multiple isoforms from the same gene at high precision. Solved by maximum likelihood estimation, isoform expression can be inferred in RNA-Seq using statistical models based on the assumption that sequenced reads are distributed uniformly along transcripts. Modification of the model is needed when considering situations where RNA-Seq data do not follow uniform distribution.Results: We proposed two curves, the global bias curve (GBC) and the local bias curves (LBCs), to describe the non-uniformity of read distributions for all genes in a transcriptome and for each gene, respectively. Incorporating the bias curves into the uniform read distribution (URD) model, we introduced non-URD (N-URD) models to infer isoform expression levels. On a series of systematic simulation studies, the proposed models outperform the original model in recovering major isoforms and the expression ratio of alternative isoforms. We also applied the new model to real RNA-Seq datasets and found that its inferences on expression ratios of alternative isoforms are more reasonable. The experiments indicate that incorporating N-URD information can improve the accuracy in modeling and inferring isoform expression in RNA-Seq.Contact:zhangxg@tsinghua.edu.cnSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
