I thank Jonathan GÃ¶ke for conceptualising this work and granting me the opportunity to work on it. I also thank him for his continual guidance, not only for the duration of this thesis, but also from the time I joined his lab in the summer of 2020. His support and patience have been invaluable.\\[10pt]
My gratitude extends also to Chen Ying and Andre Sim for their contributions to this work. The weekly discussions on this subject, the resources they have provided, and the suggestions they have given me have all shaped this work crucially.\\[10pt] 
Further thanks to all members of Jonathan's lab, whom have sat through presentations on this work and have asked questions and provided comments that have been useful. Their work is brilliant, and has given me much insight and piqued my interest in all things long-read.\\[10pt]
I also thank Prof. Greg Tucker-Kellogg for his co-supervision and for conducting great courses in bioinformatics at NUS that have laid foundations instrumental to this work.\\[10pt] 
Last but not least, I thank Prof. Choi Hyungwon for a large part of my statistical education, which has come to fruition in this work.
